            Hello! My name is Emalia. I was raised on Vashon Island, Washington, where I discovered a passion for
            digital media at a young age. I grew up homeschooled, which allowed me lots of extra time
            to fully pursue filmmaking, culminating in a film called Lieutenant Lilly. Inspired by the experience of
            expressing the way I saw the world, I attended Hofstra University. I found a particular interest in the
            study of film theory and the psychological explanations for the ways media influences our thoughts and
            emotions, and have enjoyed a career in marketing since graduation. My love of my Jewish heritage and my
            lifelong outdoor sportswomanship have guided me and will continue to shape my path in life.
